    "## Probability Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing fundamental risk factors, it is important to first define a probability space, a mathematical object that is formally defined by a three-tuple \n",
    "\n",
    "($\\mathbf{\\Omega}, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P}$), where\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is the sample space, or the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment\n",
    " 2. $\\mathcal{F}$ is the event space also called $\\sigma$-algebra, or a subset of the superset of $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$\n",
    " 3. $\\mathbb{P}: \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow [0,1]$ is a probability function that assigns a number between 0 and 1 to any event. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a fair dice. Its sample space $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. One could define the $\\sigma$-algebra to be the set of all subsets of $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ which contains elements such as $\\{5\\}$ and $\\{2,4,6\\}$ (all possible even outcomes). The probability function $\\mathbb{P}$ then maps such elements to their respective probability of occurence, eg. $\\{5\\} \\rightarrow 1/6$ and $\\{2,4,6\\} \\rightarrow 3/6 = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a construct, equipped with a set of axioms called the probability axioms build up to probability theory."

    "## Fundamental Risk Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting point for describing risk sources is by looking at fundamental risk factors such as interest rates and market movements as well as how we can use them to build a risk model. We describe future enviromental conditions by a value as a function of a future time-point $V(s)$, which acts as a random variable in a probability space $(\\mathbf{\\Omega}, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a time horizon $\\Delta$ (e.g 1 day), the loss of an investment in the period $[s, s + \\Delta]$ is given by the loss function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{[s, s+ \\Delta]} = -(V(s + \\Delta) - V(s))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V(s + \\Delta)$ is the future value and $V(s)$ is the present value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss $L_{[s, s + \\Delta]}$ at time $s+\\Delta$ is simply observable (i.e not stochastic), although at time $s$ it is not observable, meaning we need to treat it as an _unconditional_ loss distribution, which assumes we dont have all information up to time $s$. So we can describe what is commonly called the P/L Distribution as $V(s + \\Delta) - V(s)$ which is essentally $rv - L_{[s,s+\\Delta]}$ where $rv$ denotes random variable and $L_{[s,s+\\Delta]}$ denotes a loss distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in Risk Management, one is usually concerned with only the losses (i.e an insurance business cannot profit from car thefts), so we concern ourselves with only negative values of asset change.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assuming equidistant time periods, one can reduce $L_{[s,s + \\Delta]}$ to $L_{t+1}$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{t+1} = -(V(t+1) - V(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when we look at the daily losses of a position or portfolio, we set $\\Delta = 1/365$ (e.g FX) or $\\Delta = 1/252$ (e.g equities) or various other Day count conventions that factor in things like holidays and leap years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that values $V_t$ and $V_{t+1}$ denotes random variables that model the value of a portfolio at $t$ and $t+1$ respectively, whilst $L_{t+1}$ denotes the loss occured from $t$ to $t+1$. Given a scenario with $d$ risk factors taken into account, $V_t$ will be a random variable as a function of time and $\\vec{Z_t}$, a $d$-dimensional random vector which encompasses all risk factors, i.e\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_t: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}: = f(t, \\vec{Z_t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of $V_t(t, \\vec{Z_t})$ be as simple as return $\\times$ investment value, but could also get very complicated as one introduces instruments such as options. Common risk factors include interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and economic ratios. The mapping of such factors to a value function $V_t$ is called risk mapping, which will be covered in more detail in the next section.\n",
