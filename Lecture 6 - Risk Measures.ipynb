    "## Basics of Risk Measurement\n",
    "There are several ways to measure risk. In fact, we have already covered a few examples throughout this course. For example, the option _greeks_ are measures of an option price's sensitivities to various factors, which is essentially a set of risk measures. However, the greeks are limited in the sense where they cannot be aggrigated (or be combined into a single measure), which is usually necessary in risk management. Another notable risk measure are the scenario-based risk measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a set of risk factor changes $\\chi = \\{\\vec{x}_1, \\dots, \\vec{x}_n\\}$ and a set of weights $\\vec{w} = \\{w_1, \\dots, w_n\\} \\in [0,1]^n$. Given a portfolio with an associated loss operator $l_{[t]}$, the risk is now taken to be the following function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Psi_{[\\chi,w]} = \\max\\{w_1l_{[t]}(\\vec{x_1}),\\dots, w_nl_{[t]}(\\vec{x_n})\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the risk is taken to be the maximum loss adjusted for its weight (probability of occurence). Whilst this approach doesn't tend to be highly looked up upon, it is very practical and tends to be used by exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing which both use it to determine the margins for traders (see SPAN). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with scenario-based measures is that they are not derived from any theory and that it is usually difficult to accurately determine the weights. For this reason, we will stick to the more common approach of defining risk measures based on loss distributions. One can justify this method with the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Losses are the focus of risk management. Certain moments of distributions can provide monetary indicators\n",
    " - Loss distributions can be summarized on each _aggrigation level_ (individual investment, portfolio, company)\n",
    " - Diversification effects can be modeled\n",
    " - Loss distributions can be compared with eachother\n",
    " \n",
    "And the two disadvantages being 1. you need a lot of data and 2. you may have incorrect assumptions, fit the data to the wrong model, use wrong risk mapping, etc. Although one can easily tell that the disadvantages are not in the the method itself but how it is implemented (i.e one must be very careful with implementing loss-distribution). Another important point is that it is generally bad practice to set the loss distribution as a risk measure (think about presenting a distribution to a CEO -- he doesn't care, he wants a number, eg. risk is $100MM). For this reason, one must then think about _what_ they want from a loss distribution. For example, an insurance business will likely be concerned with the expected value and/or median of this distribution.\n",

    "## Axiomatic Risk Measure Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section is all based on Artzner et al. (1999) which is linked in the \"Further Reading\" section. The goal is to define valid or _coherent_ risk measures using a set of axioms, and to use those set of axioms to judge commonly used risk measures such as VaR and expected shortfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a probability triple $(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ and a time horizon $\\Delta$. We then denote the set of all random variables which are almost surely finite on $(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F})$ as $L^0(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$. A financial risk $\\mathcal{M}$ is then said to be a subset of $L^0$, or $\\mathcal{M} \\subset L^0(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{M}$ is also said to be a convex cone, meaning that given two risks (RVs) $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and a scalar $a > 0$\n",

If $\\mathcal{V}(L) > 0$ the risk is acceptable and $-\\mathcal{V}(L)$ can be taken from the position without the risk becoming unacceptable. For example, if a bank finds that $\\mathcal{V}(L) = -5000$EUR for one of its accounts, then one can withdraw up to 5000EUR without it causing any risk. If the measure was a positive number, say +5000EUR, then 5000 must be added into the account. \n",

Neglecting this axiom in portfolio optimization may lead to optimal portfolios being highly concentrated (and therefore risky).\n",
    "\n",

For example a large hedge fund trading penny stocks will corner the market and make the price react to the size of the trade itself. This implies $\\mathcal{V}(\\lambda L) > \\lambda \\mathcal{V}(L)$.

    " \n",
    "However, each of those measures have their own disadvantages. For example, the variance of a distribution is non-negative (which, based on the definition above, should raise some immediate concerns). Also, the mean and maximum loss are not robust for extreme values and in practice, tend to give pessimistic results (especially the max. loss). Finally, the maximum loss is not even a function of the loss distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk measure that is most commonly used is know as the Value at Risk (VaR). It is used by commercial banks and various other types of firms as it has been deemed the industry standard for measuring market price and credit risk.  VaR, however, is not a coherent risk measure, as it does not, in general, satisfy the axiom of subadditivity _(Axiom 2)_. It rather only satisfies it under the assumption of an elliptical loss distribution.\n",

The expected shortfall, on the other hand, is defined as the average loss of the interval $P(L \\geq l)$, or more formally\n",

    "Backtesting is the act of assessing the quality of a model or strategy using historical data. We backtest VaR by comparing the estimated VaR to the actual losses. There are several methods to backtest VaR, a very common one being the Christofferson/Pelletier test (CP Test), which assigns a boolean value for every loss, 1 being if the loss exceeds the VaR and 0 if it doesn't. For obvious reasons, the higher the value of $\\alpha$, the more 0s we should expect. The 1s should be binomially and randomly distributed.\n",

    "Using the data above, let us try and backtest the VaR using the CP Test. We will first calculate the VaR estimate for at every time step, rather than calculating it for the final timestep and keeping it constant. "

    "## Standard Techniques for Calculating VaR\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let us look at a set of techniques used for calculating VaR. In general, there are three approaches: \n",
    " \n",
    "### 1. Variance Covariance Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio where the following assumptions are valid:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Risk factors are multivariate normaly distributed, $\\vec{X}_{t+1} \\sim MN(\\vec{\\mu},\\mathbb{\n",
    "\\Sigma})$  \n",
    " 2. The linearized loss operator is of the form $l^\\Delta_{[t]}(\\vec{x}) = -(c_t + \\vec{b}_t .\\vec{x})$ where $c_t$ and $\\vec{b}_t$ are constant scalars and vectors, respectively. (e.g stock portfolio $l_{[t]}^\\Delta(x) = -V_t\\vec{w}_t.\\vec{x}$)\n",
    " \n",
    "We can then say that the linearized loss distribution follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{t+1}^\\Delta = l_{[t]}^\\Delta(\\vec{X}_{t+1}) \\sim N(-c_t - \\vec{b}_t . \\vec{\\mu}, \\vec{b}_t^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\vec{b}_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(again, sorry for the weird vector notation). In other words, given that the risk factors are normally distributed, the loss is normal too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from above that with a normal loss distribution, the VaR could be determined analytically by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$VaR_\\alpha = \\mu + \\sigma\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case, the VaR is determined by\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$VaR_\\alpha = -c_t - \\vec{b}_t . \\vec{\\mu} + \\vec{b}_t^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\vec{b}_t\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of this method is simply that one can determine the VaR analytically. However, as shown in the Python Implementation above, a normal assumption is not always valid and could yield inaccurate results (in the case above, it yielded -6percent, whilst it was empirically determined to be -9percent). Although this method could extend to other distriutions given that the linearized loss distribution is $\\sim$ the risk factor distributions.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. Historical Simulation \n",
    "\n",
    "In the python implementation above, we did not need to assume any form of a distribution, but rather need to obtain a dataset of simulated losses (for example, daily P/L returns of buying AMD). We then have to take those losses and generate a distribution (i.e histogram), and get the quantile of the distribution, which should give the VaR.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see this method is very simple and straightforward. One could implement it in minutes, as was done above. However, it is important to note that this works under the assumption that the losses follow a stationary process. This method is exclusively for unconditional models. Another downside of the historical simulation method is that it requires large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final approach is the infamous Monte Carlo method. It is very simular to Historical Simulation but with a key difference. For this method, we start by assuming distributions for each individual risk factors in $\\vec{X}_{t+1}$ (e.g $X_1 \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$, $X_2 \\sim \\beta(\\alpha, \\beta)$, etc). Here we are not limited to any distribution family and can choose any set of distributions to describe $\\vec{X}_{t+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we simulate the risk factors $m$ times $\\tilde{X}^{(1)}_{t+1}, \\dots, \\tilde{X}^{(m)}_{t+1}$. We then plug in these $m$ observations into the loss operator, giving us \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{L}^{(i)}_{t+1} = l_{[t]}(\\tilde{X}^{(i)}_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,m\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a simulated loss distribution with $m$ values, and can then calculate the VaR by getting the quantile of this distribution, similar to above. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in simple words, the difference between Historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation is that with HS, we use the real data and with MCS, we use assumed distributions based on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its advantages is its flexability. We can choose any set of distributions to describe the risk factors and can therefore generate a very broad range of loss distributions. Its disadvantage, however, is computational cost: as portfolio sizes increase and complex instruments such as derivatives are introduced, the computational power necessary to compute these simulations increases dramatically. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Python Implementation \n",

    "Probably do monte carlo as both other methods have been laid out above "
