    "## Basics of Risk Measurement\n",
    "There are several ways to measure risk. In fact, we have already covered a few examples throughout this course. For example, the option _greeks_ are measures of an option price's sensitivities to various factors, which is essentially a set of risk measures. However, the greeks are limited in the sense where they cannot be aggrigated (or be combined into a single measure), which is usually necessary in risk management. Another notable risk measure are the scenario-based risk measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a set of risk factor changes $\\chi = \\{\\vec{x}_1, \\dots, \\vec{x}_n\\}$ and a set of weights $\\vec{w} = \\{w_1, \\dots, w_n\\} \\in [0,1]^n$. Given a portfolio with an associated loss operator $l_{[t]}$, the risk is now taken to be the following function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Psi_{[\\chi,w]} = \\max\\{w_1l_{[t]}(\\vec{x_1}),\\dots, w_nl_{[t]}(\\vec{x_n})\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the risk is taken to be the maximum loss adjusted for its weight (probability of occurence). Whilst this approach doesn't tend to be highly looked up upon, it is very practical and tends to be used by exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing which both use it to determine the margins for traders (see SPAN). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problems with scenario-based measures is that they are not derived from any theory and that it is usually difficult to accurately determine the weights. For this reason, we will stick to the more common approach of defining risk measures based on loss distributions. One can justify this method with the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Losses are the focus of risk management. Certain moments of distributions can provide monetary indicators\n",
    " - Loss distributions can be summarized on each _aggrigation level_ (individual investment, portfolio, company)\n",
    " - Diversification effects can be modeled\n",
    " - Loss distributions can be compared with eachother\n",
    " \n",
    "And the two disadvantages being 1. you need a lot of data and 2. you may have incorrect assumptions, fit the data to the wrong model, use wrong risk mapping, etc. Although one can easily tell that the disadvantages are not in the the method itself but how it is implemented (i.e one must be very careful with implementing loss-distribution). Another important point is that it is generally bad practice to set the loss distribution as a risk measure (think about presenting a distribution to a CEO -- he doesn't care, he wants a number, eg. risk is $100MM). For this reason, one must then think about _what_ they want from a loss distribution. For example, an insurance business will likely be concerned with the expected value and/or median of this distribution.\n",

    "## Axiomatic Risk Measure Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section is all based on Artzner et al. (1999) which is linked in the \"Further Reading\" section. The goal is to define valid or _coherent_ risk measures using a set of axioms, and to use those set of axioms to judge commonly used risk measures such as VaR and expected shortfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a probability triple $(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ and a time horizon $\\Delta$. We then denote the set of all random variables which are almost surely finite on $(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F})$ as $L^0(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$. A financial risk $\\mathcal{M}$ is then said to be a subset of $L^0$, or $\\mathcal{M} \\subset L^0(\\mathbf{\\Omega},\\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{M}$ is also said to be a convex cone, meaning that given two risks (RVs) $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and a scalar $a > 0$\n",

If $\\mathcal{V}(L) > 0$ the risk is acceptable and $-\\mathcal{V}(L)$ can be taken from the position without the risk becoming unacceptable. For example, if a bank finds that $\\mathcal{V}(L) = -5000$EUR for one of its accounts, then one can withdraw up to 5000EUR without it causing any risk. If the measure was a positive number, say +5000EUR, then 5000 must be added into the account. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{V}(L + l) = \\mathcal{V}(L) + l$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, the composite risk of $L_1 + L_2$ will always be less than the sum of risks of $L_1$ and $L_2$. This statement axiomatically justifies diversification. Neglecting this axiom in portfolio optimization may lead to optimal portfolios being highly concentrated (and therefore risky).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 3: Positive Homogeniety**\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $L \\in \\mathcal{M}$ and every $\\lambda > 0$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{V}(\\lambda L) = \\lambda\\mathcal{V}(L)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a larger amount of capital at risk will correspond to a proportially scaled risk ratio (a simple example being CFDs). This may not be obvious because at a certain point of adding capital, there will be liquidity concerns.\n",

    "**Definition 5: Coherent Risk Measure** \n",
    "\n",
    "Any risk measure $\\mathcal{V}$ whose domain includes the convex cone $\\mathcal{M}$ is said to be coherent on $\\mathcal{M}$ iff Axioms 1-4 are satistfied.\n",

For example a large hedge fund trading penny stocks will corner the market and make the price react to the size of the trade itself. This implies $\\mathcal{V}(\\lambda L) > \\lambda \\mathcal{V}(L)$. It is for this reason that subadditivity and homeoginity definitions are treated loosely and sometimes requiring only a weaker property called convexity, or\n",

    "Now let us look at some concrete examples of risk measures of a given loss distribution, $\\mathcal{V}(L)$. Given that the loss distribution is simply a probability distribution, there are several measures that should seem intuitive. Namely,\n",

    " 1. The mean loss $\\mathcal{V}(L) = \\mathbb{L}$\n",
    " 2. The variance $\\mathcal{V}(L) = var(L)$\n",

    " \n",
    "However, each of those measures have their own disadvantages. For example, the variance of a distribution is non-negative (which, based on the definition above, should raise some immediate concerns). Also, the mean and maximum loss are not robust for extreme values and in practice, tend to give pessimistic results (especially the max. loss). Finally, the maximum loss is not even a function of the loss distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk measure that is most commonly used is know as the Value at Risk (VaR). It is used by commercial banks and various other types of firms as it has been deemed the industry standard for measuring market price and credit risk.  VaR, however, is not a coherent risk measure, as it does not, in general, satisfy the axiom of subadditivity _(Axiom 2)_. It rather only satisfies it under the assumption of an elliptical loss distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the Value at Risk gives us the worst possible outcome given a confidence level. For example, \"what is the worst case scenario of buying MSFT stock for one day, given a 95\\% confidence level\"? It is formally defined as\n",

    "**Definition 7: Value at Risk (VaR)**\n",

    "$$VaR_\\alpha = \\inf\\{l \\in \\mathbb{R}: P(L > l) \\leq (1-\\alpha)\\}\\\\ = \\inf\\{l \\in \\mathbb{R}: F_L(l) \\geq \\alpha\\}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the confidence $\\alpha$ is usually set to either 0.95 or 0.99 and the time horizon $\\Delta$ is usually set to 1 or 10 days in market risk management and 1 year in credit risk management. The figure above shows the standard $\\alpha = 0.95, \\Delta = 10$days for a market portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
