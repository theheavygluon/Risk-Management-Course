**WARNING:** In case a reader plans on using these notebooks as a reference to learning about QRM, I highly advise taking everything said with a grain of salt, as this is not my field of expertise and these notebooks are simply my notes on [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUdZFqY4sxs&list=PL4i4aZbplv9KLOA0T4Vw_6PW_eYEYGSXR). 

## Introduction

Very often in finance, a decision maker must consider the risk of every action. For example, an insurance business must price their premiums in accordance to the risk of various events, an asset manager must take into consideration their clients' risk tolerance, and a bank must have a model to determine (and ideally quantify) creditworthiness of potential debtors. This course is aimed at introducing the concept of quantitative risk, mostly in an market/banking context. Topics such as Stochastic Processes, Volatiltiy Forecasting, Mapping Risk Factors to Risk Measures are covered and implemented in Python.
