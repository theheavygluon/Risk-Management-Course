# Risk-Management-Course
Spending ~1.5hrs a day on this. NOTE: not an expert in any of this, just my notes on a course by Prof. Gregor Weiss from Leipzig University. 

To do list:
 
 - MLE + Regression + ML
 - Finish Copula section
 - Implement Univariate distribution fitting in some insurance math context
 - Implement ARCH and GARCH (and maybe even ARMA or GARCH-ARMA) (Done)
