# Risk-Management-Course
Spending ~1.5hrs a day on this. NOTE: not an expert in any of this, just my notes on a course by Prof. Gregor Weiss from Leipzig University. 

To do list:
 
 - MLE + Regression + ML
 - Finish Copula section
 - Implement Univariate distribution fitting in some insurance math context
 - ~~Implement ARCH and GARCH (and maybe even ARMA or GARCH-ARMA)~~ 
 - Do Bond Portfolio and Credit Portfolio + Python Implementation
 - Monte Carlo Simulation to Calculate VaR
